/**
 * Order = order of presentation.
 *
 * Each chapter MUST provide a `narrations: Narration[]` array. Its length
 * is the chapter's step count — there is no `totalSteps` to maintain
 * separately. This guarantees the audio synthesis pipeline, the runtime
 * stepper, and the chapter `.tsx` switch on `step` cannot drift apart.
 *
 * Visual styling (color, fonts) comes entirely from the active theme —
 * chapters never hard-code palette / font names. See THEMES.md.
